# The Challenge

Users comment on the Huffington Post more than a quarter million times every day. Curating these comments and showcasing the best conversations becomes quite difficult with so much raw data. At the same time, having so much user engagement and data allows for a significant amount of creativity, ingenuity, and flexibility on the part of the software engineer.

For this exercise, please implement a new tool for community engagement that isn't simply traditional commenting. The goal of this tool is to promote high quality discourse at scale.

Specific requirements based on your desired track are listed below -- you are only asked to meet one set of skill-specific requirements (frontend, backend, or data) in addition to the core requirements.

Please don't spend more than a few hours on this exercise. Feel free to focus on one particular dimension of the idea -- part of the challenge is distilling a large concept down to a "minimum viable product".


## Requirements:

### Core:

- You can use any programming language you like
- Do all work on Github
- Deploy code to the web (Heroku has a free tier you can use)
- Write some backend and frontend code
- Creativity is extremely important
- Use at least one technology that is new to you
- Provide a README that describes your concept


### Frontend:

- Implement the frontend using AngularJS, Backbone, or Ember
- Use at least three features of CSS3
- Use Bootstrap 3
- Use websockets (or a wrapper) to achieve realtime interactions
- Use D3.js, three.js, or a canvas library of your choosing to implement a visualization or unique UI component
- You can simulate your backend -- your backend need only serve up your UI, the rest can be "stubbed out"
- Your final product should be polished and intuitive
