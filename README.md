# Mitosis
## Making comments come alive.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
bower install
grunt dev
node app/index.js
```

## Current Status
I'm just building up my work space and getting the bare bones node server and client structure up and running.

###
always be knolling

## Running Ideas and Todos

- split up the main.js file into multiple files, pull out the api handlers

- dry up tracking dependencies in copy.js and require_config.js

- add filtering to comments for chrono and popularity?

- being said right now on the top, like a news ticker!
- can only start a new conversation if your account has enough karma (like stackoverflow?)
